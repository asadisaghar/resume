    \item \small{Built experimental computer vision based components for predictive maintenance data collection and analysis onboard ships (Innovation Garage AS)}

    \item \small{Built an app to monitor the company internal data
      flow, making customer data reliably consistent across
      departments and software systems (SpeedLedger)}

    \item \small{Developed and visualized performance metrics for
      multiple departments (SpeedLedger)}

    \item \small{Presented the results of my research to both
      professional and public audience (2012--2016)}

    \item \small{Organized numerous science outreach programs from the
      age of 15 (2001--2016)}

    \item \small{Organized the first graduate--level machine learning
      course across physics and astronomy departments at Stockhom
      University (2015)}

    \item \small{Wrote simulation software for the first Swedish SETI
      project (Stockholm University 2015)}

    \item \small{Developed data analysis methods to optimize the
      sensitivity and resolution of radio interferometers with the end
      goal of constraining the mass of dark matter particles
      (MSc./PhD)}

    \item \small{Made simulations to estimate the ability of
      near--future radio interferometers to constrain the standard
      model of dark matter (MSc./PhD)}

    \item \small{Worked in a team introducing extra--curricular science
      projects in a few high schools in Tehran for the first time,
      encouraging critical thinking about science as well as the
      educational environment. Many of those students have since gone
      on to pursue careers in science (2005--2009)}

    \item \small{Served in organizing/scientific committees of several
      physics/astrophysics conferences for high--school students
      (2005--2009)}
